# Bootstrap Assets

This directory contains example artifacts used when seeding a new environment.

- `scripts/`: Opinionated scaffolding for preparing spoke clusters.
  - `spoke1/addons/`: Sample addon catalog, enablement toggles, and Helm values (`catalog.yaml`, `enablement.yaml`, `values.yaml`).
  - `spoke1/cluster-values/cluster-values.yaml`: Template values for layering cluster-specific overrides.
  - `spoke1/infrastructure/`: Kustomize skeleton and values for infrastructure resources generated by KRO.
  - `spoke1/values.yaml`: Aggregated configuration that ties the sample spoke together.
  - `spoke1/sample.gen3.url.org`: Placeholder host name used in the sample configuration set.

Use these files as references when cloning the repo for a new tenant or spoke; production configuration lives under `live/`.
