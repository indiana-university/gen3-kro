# Environment Configuration

Runtime environment definitions for Terragrunt live here. Each region or account gets its own folder beneath `aws/`.

- `aws/us-east-1/gen3-kro-hub/`:
  - `config.yaml`: Source of truth for hub VPC, EKS, GitOps, and ACK/addon enablement.
  - `terragrunt.hcl`: Loads `config.yaml`, flattens the data model, and wires Terraform combinations/modules.
  - `diabled-addons.yaml`: Catalog of optional addons with pod identity metadata; merged into hub settings.
  - `.terraform.lock.hcl`: Provider lock file produced by `terragrunt init`.
  - `.terragrunt-cache/`: Build cache generated by Terragrunt (safe to delete).
  - `providers.tf.tpl`: Template injected into auto-generated Terraform code by Terragrunt.
- `aws/iam/`: Account/role placeholders for delegating IAM management through GitOps.

Add new environments by copying a region folder, updating `config.yaml`, and pointing the corresponding Terragrunt stack at the right backend settings in `backend.hcl`.
