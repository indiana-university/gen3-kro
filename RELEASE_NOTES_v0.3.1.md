# Release Notes - v0.3.1

## Overview
This release focuses on major architectural refactoring of the ArgoCD deployment structure, infrastructure fixes, and CI/CD improvements. The release introduces a new bootstrap pattern and comprehensive deployment documentation while fixing critical infrastructure issues.

## Key Changes

### 🚀 Major Features

#### ArgoCD Architecture Refactoring
- **New Bootstrap Structure**: Complete redesign of ArgoCD deployment architecture
  - Migrated from monolithic hub/spokes structure to modular bootstrap pattern
  - Introduced `argocd/bootstrap/` directory with ApplicationSets for addons, graphs, and instances
  - Created `argocd/application-sets/` for centralized ApplicationSet management
  - Implemented Wave-based deployment strategy (Wave 0: addons, Wave 1: graphs, Wave 2: infrastructure, Wave 3: workloads)

#### Infrastructure Fixes
- **Terragrunt Configuration**: Fixed critical duplicate `inputs` block in `terraform/live/prod/terragrunt.hcl`
  - Resolved terraform destroy failures
  - Successfully destroyed 124 AWS resources in staging environment
  - Cleaned up argocd namespace and finalizers

#### CI/CD Improvements
- **Smart Version Bumping**: Redesigned version management script (`.github/workflows/version-bump.sh`)
  - Intelligent version detection: compares `.version` file with latest git tag
  - Auto-bump patch version when major/minor unchanged
  - Use explicit version from file when major/minor changed
  - Automatic git tagging with proper semantic versioning

### 📚 Documentation

#### Comprehensive Deployment Plans
- **6-Phase Deployment Strategy**: Created detailed phased rollout plan in `argocd/plans/`
  - Phase 0: Foundation Setup (IAM, Terraform, Secrets)
  - Phase 1: Hub Bootstrap (EKS, ArgoCD)
  - Phase 2: Platform Addons (KRO, ACK controllers)
  - Phase 3: Resource Graphs (RGD deployment)
  - Phase 4: Spoke Infrastructure (EKS cluster provisioning)
  - Phase 5: Workload Deployment (Gen3 applications)

- **Technical Documentation**: Each phase includes:
  - Step-by-step task breakdowns
  - Validation checklists
  - Rollback procedures
  - Troubleshooting guides
  - Success criteria and time estimates

#### Code Cleanup
- **Streamlined Documentation**: Removed bloat from all phase documents
  - Eliminated duration/risk/team metadata
  - Removed sign-off sections and budget references
  - Added consistent ownership footer across all documents

### 🔧 Infrastructure Changes

#### AWS Resource Management
- **Clean Infrastructure State**: Successfully destroyed all staging resources
  - 124 AWS resources removed (VPC, subnets, EKS cluster, security groups, etc.)
  - Clean slate for new deployment architecture
  - Verified argocd namespace removal

#### Repository Structure
- **Organized Directory Layout**:
  ```
  argocd/
  ├── application-sets/     # Centralized ApplicationSets
  ├── bootstrap/           # New bootstrap pattern
  │   ├── addons.yaml
  │   ├── graphs.yaml
  │   ├── gen3-instances.yaml
  │   └── graph-instances.yaml
  └── plans/               # Deployment documentation
      ├── Phase0.md through Phase5.md
      └── deployment-plan.md
  ```

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Terragrunt Configuration
- **Duplicate Inputs Block**: Fixed HCL parsing error in production terragrunt configuration
- **Terraform Destroy**: Resolved hanging destroy operations
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of AWS resources and Kubernetes namespaces

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Version Management**: Fixed version bumping logic for automated releases
- **Git Tagging**: Improved semantic versioning with proper tag creation

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments
1. **Backup Current State**: Current staging environment has been backed up
2. **Clean Reinstall**: Use new bootstrap pattern for fresh deployments
3. **Version File**: Update `.version` file to desired version before deployment

### Breaking Changes
- **ArgoCD Structure**: Old `argocd/hub/` and `argocd/spokes/` structures deprecated
- **ApplicationSets**: New centralized ApplicationSet management required
- **Wave Deployment**: Must follow new wave-based deployment order

## Testing Status
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform validation passes, destroy operations successful
- **CI Scripts**: Version bump script tested and working
- **Documentation**: All phase documents validated for consistency
- **ArgoCD**: New bootstrap structure created but not yet deployed/tested

## Known Issues
- **ArgoCD Deployment**: New bootstrap pattern requires full testing cycle
- **Wave Dependencies**: Strict wave ordering must be maintained
- **Resource Limits**: AWS resource quotas may need adjustment for spoke deployments

## Future Work
- Complete testing of new ArgoCD bootstrap pattern
- Implement automated testing for deployment phases
- Add monitoring and alerting for deployment health checks
- Create rollback automation for failed deployments
